## Usage

Before running `odin-slides`, you need to ensure that you have set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable named `ODIN_SLIDES_LLM_API_KEY`. This API key is required for the application to communicate with the OpenAI services. 

> **Notice:** Make sure that you put usage limits on the keys that you create and regularly rotate your keys. This helps ensure the security of your API access and prevents misuse.


Once you have set the API key, you can execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
odin-slides -t <template_file> -o <output_file> [-i <input_file_path>] [-s <session_file_path>]
```

`<template_file>`: Path to an existing PowerPoint file to copy the layout theme from.

`<output_file>`: Desired output file name for the presentation (without the extension).

`<input_file_path>` (optional): Path to an input Word document to create the presentation based on. Large Word documents will be automatically summarized for presentation purposes.

`<session_file_path>` (optional): Path to a previously saved session file to resume.

Note: For input files larger than 5000 words, odin-slides automatically summarizes them for presentation purposes. You can also resume sessions to continue your presentation creation journey.

## Examples

- Create a new presentation from scratch:

```bash
odin-slides -t /path/to/template.pptx -o my_presentation
```

- Resume a session and continue working on a presentation:

```bash
odin-slides -t /path/to/template.pptx -o my_presentation -s /path/to/my_presentation_session.pkl
```

- Generate a presentation from an existing Word document:

```bash
odin-slides -t /path/to/template.pptx -o my_presentation -i /path/to/input.docx
```


## Supported File Types

odin-slides currently supports the following file types for input documents:

- Microsoft Word (docx): Easily generate presentations from your existing Word documents. Even large Word documents are automatically summarized for concise and effective presentation creation. (Note: Other file types such as LaTeX and PDF will be supported in future updates.)
